  "DESCRIPTION": {
    "summary": "This proposal has two goals: first, to help Richard develop his project, and second, to demonstrate the first live DAO vote using Worldcoin's WorldID to verify proof of personhood. Wonderland received a grant from the Worldcoin Foundation to showcase what a Sybil-resistant 'one vote per human' system would look like, and this is it!\n\nAs a first implementation, we chose to do some good by contributing to Richard's project. Please vote using your Worldcoin app!"
